      A.(Research) Which standards affects organizational carbon footprint measurement, calculation
      and reporting?
    </p>
    <p>
      A) Acording to GGP (GHG Protocol), standarts are Corporate Standard, GHG Protocol for Cities, Mitigation Goal
      Standard, Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard, Policy and Action Standard, Product Standard, Project Protocol
      <br />
      Also, ISO14064 is released standard by ISO
    </p>
    <p>
      B.(Research) According to the GHG Protocol, what determines an activity emission to be counted as Scope 1, 2 or 3?
      Describe with an example for each of the three scopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      B) <br />
      Scope 1 : Direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by the company. For example, burning fuel for power or
      heat, through chemical reactions, and from leaks from industrial processes or equipment. <br />
      Scope 2 : Indirect emisions from purchased electricity. If I understand right it caclucalting with electricity
      spends but I am not sure about that. <br />
      Scope 3 : Indirect, upstream sources not owned or controlled by the company. For example, business travels. more
      example is in <a href="https://www.ghginsight.com/what-are-scope-3-emissions/"> this link</a>
